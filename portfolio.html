            <h2>Lottery Game</h2>
            <h3>HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Visual Studio</h3>
            A simple lottery game where the player chooses 6 lottery balls and try to match 3 or more to win.

            You can view and play the game <a href="./lottery/lottery.html">here.</a><br>
            You can download a copy of the game <a href="files/Lottery.zip" download>here.</a><br><br>

            <h2>Annihilation Intelligence</h2>

            <h3>Android Studio, Java, jPCT-AE</h3>
            Annihilation Intelligence (AI) was my Final Year Project during my third year at university. Developed using Java in Android Studio with <a href="http://www.jpct.net/jpct-ae/">jPCT-AE</a>,
            a 3D solution for Java and Android.<br>
            AI is a 3D 1<sup>st</sup> Person Horror Room Escape mobile phone game developed for the Android OS, created to explore the term <i>'Horror Vacui'</i>, and creating a game without this concept.
            The project was also a chance for me to explore creating and developing a 3D game for mobile phones, which is not covered much in my university course, as well as to see what it takes to
            create an entire game, including all assets, from start to finish. In a sense this project was also designed as a look into indie games, a concept of game development which has become more
            popular over the last decade or so.<br><br>

            <h2>Leap Engine</h2>
            <img class="portImg" id="leapIMG" src="images/leap1.png" alt="Leap Engine" onclick="OpenModal(102)" style="border: 3px solid black; float: right" />
            <h3>Visual Studio, C++, OpenGL</h3>
            Leap Engine is a group developed coursework project made during my Third year of university as part of the Games Programming module. This was created alongside four other members
            as a 3D Games Engine, which was also used to create a 3D Platformer game: DiamondsInTheSky.exe. This engine made use of a structure inspired by Unity, implementing entities which
            can be given components.<br><br>
            I worked on several different aspects of this project: <br>
            <h3>Assets & Animations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The audio assets, creating music using <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a> and sound effects using <a href="https://www.bfxr.net/">Bfxr</a></li>
                <li>Many of the 3D models and textures, including various objects such as the collectibles, the walls and platforms, as well as...</li>
                <li>
                    The Player and Enemy models, textures and animations, using <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview">Autodesk Maya</a> and creating textures using Microsoft
                    Paint and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Programming & Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Audio component, which can be attached to entities to play music or sound effects, made using the sound library <a href="https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/">irrKlang</a></li>
                <li>The Text Renderer component, using <a href="https://www.freetype.org/">FreeType</a> to draw a 2D shader on top of the 3D program for the UI</li>
                <li>The Animated Renderer component, using <a href="http://www.assimp.org/">Assimp</a> to import .fbx format animations for the Player and Enemy models</li>
                <li>Game Design elements such as the level design and gameplay mechanics</li>
            </ul>
            Much like my final year project <a href="#ai">Annihilation Intelligence</a>, I was very interested in many different parts of the game engine and development, and wanted to work on
            many different aspects of the engine. This project was a good chance to work as a team on a project in different areas to each other, yet still helping each other out when a problem
            arises, or when there are clashes when attempting to bring the project together.<br><br>

            <h2>Ludum Dare 38 - A Small World - Lick's Cavern</h2>
            <img class="portImg" id="lickIMG" src="images/lick1.jpg" alt="Licks Cavern" onclick="OpenModal(103)" style="border: 3px solid black; float: right" />
            <h3>Unity, C#</h3>
            I took part in a 72 hour Ludum Dare Games Jam, featuring the theme: A Small World. With only 72 hours, me and and my friend Rozen who I met during my time at univeristy
            came up with and created this game using Unity, with both of us only doing most of one tutorial prior. We used this Ludum Dare as a chance to try out using Unity and C#
            for games development. All parts of the game, including art and music, were created by us during the 72 hours.<br>
            For this project I worked on several areas. Assets wise, I created most of the assets used in this project, including a simple theme made using <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>,
            and most of the sprites and tiles used in the project. These sprites were fairly basic and made quickly due to the time restriction, being created in Microsoft Paint, and using
            <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> as well for creating them, and for adding transparency.<br>
            <h3>What I worked on</h3>
            On the programming side, I focused on the Player and the Enemies, and the Cards System -although this was added fairly late and it could not reach its potential-. For the player,
            this included basic movement, and the Hook/Lick ability: Using the player's tongue to attack enemies, and to use as a grappling hook to traverse the map, as well as attack enemies
            by grappling past them. The Cards System was an addition I made near the end of the project. I had originally planned them as power-ups the player could collect, such as cards to
            increase the player's speed or damage, and as consumable power-ups to recover health or gain abilities briefly.<br>
            Overall, it was a great experience to take part in a games jam, which are always hectic and fun, but also it was a great chance to try out Unity and C#, which was barely
            touched upon in university.<br><br>

            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <h3>Visual Studio, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
            This website was created by me making use of Github Pages to host both the repository and the actual website. This was created using Visual Studio in HTML and CSS,
            using a base TypeScript template to allow the usage of TypeScript or JavaScript for this site in the future.<br>

            <h3>HTML, JavaScript, CSS</h3>
            Lineout is a Breakout-style game that I created during my first year of university as part of learning HTML, JavaScript and CSS.<br><br>
