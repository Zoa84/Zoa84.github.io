# Zoa84.github.io
Personal Website / Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal/portfolio website, which can be viewed here: https://zoa84.github.io/

This is created using Visual Studio, and uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used a TypeScript template in Visual Studio for this project, in case TypeScript becomes a useful feature for the website.
