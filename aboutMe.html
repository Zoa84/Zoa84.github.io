        <p>
            I am a Computer Games Programming graduate from De Montfort University, graduating 1st Class with Honours, and have recently finished working as a Games Tester at
            Rockstar Lincoln, looking to move into a more programming based role. I would describe myself as a friendly person who's always willing to help others. I generally
            learn and pick up new things very quickly, and can motivate myself to work through a project or job on my own, or to work alongside others in a group where necessary.<br><br>

            I enjoy taking on challenging problems, especially mathematical and problem-solving tasks, where it is important to think through a task rather than tackle
            it head on.

        <!--Interests and Hobbies-->
        <p>
            I've always enjoyed video games, playing them from an early age and still playing them now in my spare time. I'm interested in many genres from Action and RPGs
            to Music and Card games. Recently I have completed Resident Evil 2 on PS4, Resident Evil being one of my favourite series for the Survival Horror genre. I have
            also completed Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night on PC, a bit buggy as many people have noticed with one or two crashes, but the gameplay was very enjoyable, much 
            like the Castlevania games on DS I used to play.<br><br>
            In my spare time I also play guitar, although I am not very experienced. I mostly play acoustic guitar and play songs that I like, namely James Morrison and James
            Blunt, but also others. I also have an interest in South Korea and Korean culture in the form of their music Kpop, which has recently expanded more to the West, but
            also Korean dramas (KDramas) and Korean variety shows. In the past I also learned TaeKwonDo, and went climbing/bouldering and played badminton during university, both 
            of which I enjoyed and would like to take up again.<br><br>
            I aspire to further my programming skills as well as my knowledge and understanding of the production of a game or app, and of the games industry. I have a
            keen interest in video games, both playing them in my spare time, and creating them. Examples of this include various Games Jams and Hackathons: working in a
            group to design and create an application in a short time following a theme or purpose, as well as learning and using different software on my own.<br>

            <h2>Employment</h2>
            <h3>Games Tester at Rockstar Lincoln</h3>
            I worked testing mostly Red Dead Redemption 2 on both Singleplayer and Multiplayer, testing both generally and on a focused area of the project. This also
            included travelling up to Rockstar North for training and testing, and working as part of a team in an area as well as separately depending on what is required.<br><br>
            Working here has given me a huge insight into the Games Industry, as well as the level of detail that Rockstar Games goes into in creating their games. I also experienced 
            the crunch period coming up to the release of Red Dead Redemption 2, and having to manage my time between work and personal life, as well as managing what needed to be done 
            at work.<br><br>
            Testing included working through a test plan when working through a new area, or when working through an existing area to find new bugs from the latest build, doing sweeps of 
            specific areas especially if there were major changes made to those areas, and testing on different platforms and consoles.
