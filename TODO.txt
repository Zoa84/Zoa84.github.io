Update footer to use a repeating image? May be fine as is

Update Portfolio page,
-Use tables to show off projects vertically? May be fine as is for now, until more projects
-Look up about making viewable pictures in a mini window of sorts
-AI-Add more info?

Add a "Featured Products" to the home page for most recent/best works? (May be better to add later)




Blog:
Add a 'tags'/'hashtags' system of sorts, the most simple version would be to just have these tags under a blog post or in the description to give the reader an idea what the post is about
