Update footer to use a repeating image? May be fine as is

Update Portfolio page,
-Use tables to show off projects vertically? May be fine as is for now, until more projects
-AI-Add more info?

Add a "Featured Products" to the home page for most recent/best works? (May be better to add later)(Could be a cycling image of projects, and clicking it will go to the page of that project




Blog:
Add a 'tags'/'hashtags' system of sorts, the most simple version would be to just have these tags under a blog post or in the description to give the reader an idea what the post is about
Change the Nav bar in Blog to have smaller text for each post, and remove the underline to read the dates better


Portfolio:
Look into changing how the modal gallery works on mobile/tablet/different screen sizes
Change the overall style of the modal box, e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_js_lightbox
