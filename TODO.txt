Update footer to use a repeating image? May be fine as is

Update Portfolio page,
-Use tables to show off projects vertically? May be fine as is for now, until more projects
-Look up about making viewable pictures in a mini window of sorts
-AI-Add more info?

Add a "Featured Products" to the home page for most recent/best works? (May be better to add later)






Look into creating a blog area/page to add blog posts for current projects
