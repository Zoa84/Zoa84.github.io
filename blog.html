            <p>
                Hi everyone, this is my first attempt at a blog post, after getting around to adding a blog to my website. This blog is very simple, using only HTML and CSS
                to create the blog format over the existing website design, and creating an example blog post which I can then create future blog posts with.
                <br>
                Creating future blog posts with this is unfortunately very manual, having to access this HTML page and manually copy and paste a blog post and updating all the 
                information in it, followed by adding a link to the Navigation bar to the right for the new post. This will also be problematic when I come to having multiple 
                blog posts and trying to keep them all together in one page. If and when that does happen, I'll try to implement multiple blog HTML pages, each one representing 
                a year, e.g. when it becomes 2020, I'll create a blog2019.html page which will have all the posts from that year, and a link from the latest blog page to that.
                <br><br>
                That's all from me for the moment, I plan on using this blog for updates on any projects I am working on or have finished, any updates I make to this website, and 
                possibly blog posts for other things such as games I am currently playing or have completed, or whatever might come to mind. I most likely won't make this blog a 
                daily blog, as I'll likely run out of things to post about.
                <br>
                As for a comments section for these posts, I currently don't have any plans for them, but if you do have any comments or questions for me, feel free to contact me 
                using the information under <a href="./contact.html">Contacts & Links</a>, and any comments which seem relevant to a post, I'll add in manually onto the post.

                <br><br>
                Thanks all, and see you next time!
            </p>
