            Hello and welcome. My name is Simon Chiu, and I also go by the username Zoa84 for various other sites.<br><br>
            I am a Computer Games Programming graduate, graduating in 2017 at De Montfort University with a 1st Class Honours, and have worked at Rockstar Lincoln for over a year and a half as a Games Tester.<br><br>
            Now I am looking to move away from Quality Assurance and into a more programming-oriented role. If you wish to learn more about me, or view my portfolio or contact information, please use the links above to navigate this website.<br>
            Thank you for visiting.
        </p>
